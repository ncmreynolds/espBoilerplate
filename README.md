# espBoilerplate
A low-functionality Arduino library for managing Wi-Fi connections on ESP8266/8285/32 boards, mostly it provides human-readable feedback over a Stream, usually "Serial". This library consists mostly of human readable boilerplate rather than trying to replicate the complexity of more complete Wi-Fi manager libraries.
